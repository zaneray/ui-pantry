The ZaneRay UI Pantry is a storehouse for reusable core Vue components as well as thoughtful, flexible and accessible UI pattern components.  

The components in this library are intentionally styled very plainly, allowing them to be styled specifically to meet the display needs of the project that they get used in.

This library ships with no compiled CSS, but does use a set of internal SCSS variables to inform the default values of each component's styles.

## Components Types

### Base Components
These are core components that encapsualte base HTML functionality such as displaying images, creating form elements, etc.

### Pattern Components
Patterns are compositions of base elements into useful UI configurations that can be used across many sites.

### Utility Components
Useful components that enable advanced interaction and layout features to the developer.
